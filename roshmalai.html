            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <li>In a saucepan, bring 4 cups of milk to a boil. Once it reaches the boiling point, turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in the mixture of ¼ cup white vinegar and ¼ cup of water. This will break the milk into cheese.</li>
            <li>Strain the milk using a strainer or cheese cloth. Rinse with cold water to remove the sour taste from the vinegar and stop the cooking process.</li>
            <li>Gently wring out as much water as you can, then let it drain for 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a different pan, reduce 4 cups of milk and ¼ cup of powdered milk to half of its original volume.</li>
            <li>Once it has reduced, add the rose syrup, cardamom powder, condensed milk, pistachios, almonds, and a small pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture into a separate pot and allow it to cool.</li>
            <li>Take the strained cheese and add 1 tsp corn starch. Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Shape the cheese into small balls, remembering they will double in size after cooking. Ensure your hands are clean and avoid cracks in the balls.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, add 4 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar, bringing it to a boil. Once boiling, add the cheese balls, cover, and cook for 15 minutes over medium heat. Gently shake them every 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>After they have cooked well, remove the cover, add ice to stop the cooking process and let them cool.</li>
            <li>Squeeze out the water from each sweet cheese ball and drop it into the cooled, pink milk syrup.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your Roshmalai is ready! For a beautiful presentation, garnish with some rose petals before serving. Enjoy!</p>
