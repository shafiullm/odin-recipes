            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <li>Begin by toasting the dry red chilies over low heat until they become crisp. Add ½ tsp of oil to enhance the flavor. The longer and better you toast them, the more elevated your dish will be.</li>
            <li>Use a mortar and pestle to roughly crush the toasted chilies.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mash the boiled potatoes well. Add the crushed toasted red chili, ½ tsp of salt, ¼ tsp of black salt, 4 tbsp of chopped coriander, and 1 tsp of mustard oil. Mix all these ingredients thoroughly.</li>
            <li>On the side, boil 2-3 eggs for approximately 10-12 minutes. After boiling, transfer the eggs to cold water to halt the cooking process.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are cooled, peel and cut each egg into 4 pieces.</li>
            <li>Shape a ball of the potato mixture, embed a piece of egg into it, and mold it like a chop.</li>
            <li>Create a flour slurry by mixing 1 tbsp of all-purpose flour (maida) with 4 tbsp of water.</li>
            <li>Dip the potato-egg chop in the flour slurry, then coat it with breadcrumbs that have been seasoned with a pinch of black pepper and coriander.</li>
            <li>Once coated, place the chops in the refrigerator to cool for about an hour. This step ensures the coating will not break open while frying.</li>
            <li>After cooling, heat oil in a pan. Fry the chops over high heat until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Drain the excess oil and remove the chops from the heat.</li>
            <li>Plate your delicious street-style dim chops and garnish them with a sprinkle of black salt.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your yummy dim chops, a recipe that transports you to the busy streets where street hawkers serve this mouthwatering delicacy. Your taste buds are sure to thank you!</p>
