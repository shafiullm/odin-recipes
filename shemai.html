            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <li>In a large saucepan, bring the 6 cups of milk to a boil. Once boiling, set it aside.</li>
            <li>In a different pan, add 2 tbsp of ghee.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp each of raisins, cashews, pistachios, and slivered almonds to the pan with the ghee.</li>
            <li>Toast the dry fruits in the pan until the raisins become fluffy. Be careful not to burn them. Once done, set them aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add the 150 gm of semai or vermicelli.</li>
            <li>Roast the semai over medium heat until it turns light brown. This should take about 4-5 minutes. Make sure to stir continuously to prevent it from burning.</li>
            <li>Pour the roasted semai into the saucepan with the warm milk.</li>
            <li>Add 2 small cinnamon sticks and 3 cardamom pods to the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook the semai in the milk for another 4-5 minutes, or until the semai is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Add ¼ cup of condensed milk and 2 tbsp of sugar to the saucepan. Adjust the sugar to taste.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt. This will enhance the sweet flavor of the phirni.</li>
            <li>Stir in the reserved toasted dry fruits.</li>
            <li>Lastly, add 1 tsp of kewra water for aroma and flavor.</li>
            <li>If the semai phirni thickens too much, add a little more milk to loosen it up.</li>
            <li>Serve the semai phirni warm or chilled as per your preference.</li>
        </ol>
